It is ## Aadhar for Medicine.
We aim to provide frictionless user experience.

## Objective: Maintaining and Providing an Electronic Health Record has been defined as the key to providing quality care to patients. Our aim is to create a Universal Medical Identification card that can be used by every citizen just like the Aadhar Card provided by the government. This Medical Card would provide access to the complete medical history of the owner.

## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION: 
The card will provide authentication through RFID card as the first level of authentication followed by another level of authentication through a password which will provide different access levels.
A flutter app would provide features to append and show the medical history to the user according to the user’s access level.
The medicine data could be added to the database by capturing a photo of the prescription through the app and implementing OCR on the photo to extract name of the medicines.
All the useful data of the added medicines would be provided in the app so the patients could be more aware. The app would also provide reminders for the scheduled medicine taking time.

## APPLICATIONS:
Our medical identification card would provide quick access to the necessary medical data to doctors in emergency cases so that they can proceed with the treatment accordingly.
Taking of Unprescribed drugs is serious issue worldwide which takes the life of many people every year. Using the UMID card, pharmacists would only provide those medicines that are added in the database by doctors so no unprescribed medicines can be distributed.
